## Keyboard layout remaps

I use the Glove80 keyboard, so my keyboard remaps are baked into the firmware of the keyboard itself.

**Note** haven't spent any time investigating this, but if I'm traveling and am unable to use the Glove80, it would be nice to have my keyboard layout applied to the laptop keyboard as well. 
- [ ] investigate if I can have a layout applied dynamically based on whether I have the Glove80s hooked up or not. Possibly a keypress toggle?
